Changelog
=========

nose2 uses semantic versioning (currently in 0.x) and the popular
"keep a changelog" format (v1.0.0).

nose2 tries not to break backwards compatibility in any release. Until v1.0,
versions are numbered `0.MAJOR.MINOR`. Major releases introduce new
functionality or contain necessary breaking changes. Minor releases are
primarily used for bugfix or small features which are unlikely to break users'
testsuites.

0.13.0 (Unreleased)
-------------------

* Remove support for python2 and older python3 versions

* Fix support for python3.12 to avoid warnings about ``addDuration``.
  Thanks to :user:`cclauss` for the fix!

* ``nose2`` package metadata is converted to pyproject.toml format, using
  ``setuptools``. Building ``nose2`` packages from source now requires
  ``setuptools>=61.0.0`` or a PEP 517 compatible build frontend
  (e.g. ``build``).

* ``nose2`` license metadata has been corrected in format and content to be
  distributed in the sdist and wheel distributions correctly. Thanks
  :user:`musicinmybrain` for helping research this issue!

0.12.0 (2022-07-16)
-------------------

.. note::

   The 0.12.x series will be the final releases of ``nose2`` which support
   Python 2.

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Passing ``--junit-xml-path`` now implies ``--junit-xml`` when using the
  junitxml plugin. This means that the ``--junit-xml`` flag can be omitted
  when ``--junit-xml-path`` is specified. (:issue:`521`)

* Remove the dependency on ``coverage``. Use of the coverage plugin now
  requires that you either install ``coverage`` independently, or use the
  extra, ``nose2[coverage_plugin]``. As a result, ``nose2`` no longer has any
  strict dependencies

* Remove the dependency on ``six``, instead using a vendored copy. This
  ensures that the dependency for ``nose2`` doesn't conflict with application
  dependencies

Removed
~~~~~~~

* ``nose2`` no longer provides an entry-point named based on the current python
  version, e.g. ``nose2-3.8`` on python3.8 . Only the ``nose2`` command is
  provided.

* Remove support for ``setup.py test`` on ``nose2`` itself. This usage is
  deprecated by setuptools. Developers contributing to ``nose2`` are encouraged
  to use ``tox`` to run ``nose2``'s testsuite, per the contributing guide.

0.11.0 (2022-02-12)
-------------------

This is the first version of `nose2` using `sphinx-issues` to credit
contributors in the changelog.

Added
~~~~~

* Test classes now have their short description (first line of docstring)
  printed in verbose output

* The junitxml plugin now sets ``timestamp`` on each ``testcase`` node as an
  ISO-8601 timestamp. Thanks to :user:`deeplow` for the contribution!

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Drop support for Python 3.5

* Python 3.10 is now officially supported. Python 3.11-dev will be supported on
  a best-effort basis. Thanks to :user:`hugovk` and :user:`tirkarthi` for their
  contributions!

* ``nose2`` source code is now autoformatted with ``black`` and ``isort``

* ``nose2`` has switched its main development branch from ``master`` to ``main``

* Releases are now published using `build <https://github.com/pypa/build>`_

Fixed
~~~~~

* Add support for test classes when running with the multiprocessing plugin.
  Thanks to :user:`ltfish` for the initial contribution and
  :user:`stefanholek` for the refinement to this change!

* Various documentation fixes


0.10.0 (2021-01-27)
-------------------

Added
~~~~~

* Support for subtests!

Notes for plugin authors about subtest support:

  * Subtest failures will produce a ``TestOutcomeEvent`` with ``outcome = "subtest"``

  * Subtest events can be failures, but they do not indicate success -- the
    containing test will send a success event if no subtests fail

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Drop support for Python 3.4

* Python 3.8 and 3.9 are now officially supported

* Improve helptext for the multiprocess plugin's ``-N`` option

* When run with reduced verbosity (e.g. with ``-q``), ``nose2`` will no longer
  print an empty line before test reports

Fixed
~~~~~

* The plugin registry will no longer contain duplicate plugins and or base
  ``event.Plugin`` instances

* Fix function test case implementation of ``id``, ``__str__``, and
  ``__repr__``. This removes the injected ``transplant_class.<locals>`` from
  reporting output

* Doctest loading will now skip ``setup.py`` files in the project root

* Class methods decorated (e.g. with ``mock.patch``) are no longer incorrectly
  picked up by the function loader

------------------

Added
~~~~~

* Add ``--junit-xml-path`` to the junit plugin argument list

Fixed
~~~~~

  long as all of the coverage config is put into the config file

* Minor changes to be compatible with newer pythons (3.8, 3.9)

0.9.1 (2019-04-02)
------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

* the prof plugin now uses ``cProfile`` instead of ``hotshot`` for profiling, and
  therefore now supports python versions which do not include ``hotshot``

* skipped tests now include the user's reason in junit XML's ``message`` field

Fixed
~~~~~

* the prettyassert plugin mishandled multi-line function definitions

* Using a plugin's CLI flag when the plugin is already enabled via config no
  longer errors -- it is a no-op instead

0.9.0 (2019-03-17)
------------------

Added
~~~~~

* nose2.plugins.prettyassert, enabled with ``--pretty-assert``, which
  pretty-prints AssertionErrors generated by ``assert`` statements

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Update trove classifier to "beta" from "alpha" status

* Cleanup code for EOLed python versions

* Fixed sort key generation for layers.

0.4.3 (2012-11-21)

~~~~~

* Fixed unpredictable ordering of layer tests.

0.4.1 (2012-06-18)
------------------

Includes changes from version ``0.4``, never released.

* nose2.plugins.testclasses to support loading tests from ordinary classes that
  are not subclasses of unittest.TestCase.
* ``nose2.main.PluggableTestProgram`` now accepts an ``extraHooks`` keyword
  argument, which allows attaching arbitrary objects to the hooks system.

Changed
~~~~~~~

* The default script target was changed from ``nose2.main`` to ``nose2.discover``.
  The former may still be used for running a single module of tests,
  unittest-style. The latter ignores the ``module`` argument. Thanks to

  to be silently ignored.
* Fixed missing __unittest flag in several modules. Thanks to
  Wouter Overmeire for the patch.

----------------

Initial release.
