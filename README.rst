Welcome to nose2
================

**Note**: As of 0.7.0 we no longer support 2.6, 3.2, or 3.3. We also removed ``nose2.compat``.

``nose2`` aims to improve on nose by:

 * providing a better plugin api
 * being easier for users to configure
 * simplifying internal interfaces and processes
 * supporting Python 2 and 3 from the same codebase, without translation
 * encouraging greater community involvement in its development

In service of some those goals, some features of ``nose`` *are not*
supported in ``nose2``. See `differences`_ for a thorough rundown.

Workflow
--------

If you want to make contributions, you can use the ``Makefile`` to get started
quickly and easily::

    # no prior setup necessary!
    make test

Use ``make help`` to see other options.

Original Mission & Present Goals
--------------------------------

When ``nose2`` was first written, the plan for its future was to wait for
``unittest2`` plugins to be released (``nose2`` is actually based on the
plugins branch of ``unittest2``).
Once that was done, ``nose2`` was to become a set of plugins and default
configuration for ``unittest2``.

However, based on the current status of ``unittest2``, it is doubtful that this
plan will ever be carried out.

Current Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even though ``unittest2`` plugins never arrived, ``nose2`` is still being
maintained!
We have a small community interested in continuing to work on and use ``nose2``

However, given the current climate, with much more interest accruing around
`pytest`_, ``nose2`` is prioritizing bugfixes and maintenance ahead of new
feature development.
