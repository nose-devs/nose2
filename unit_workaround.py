"""
Python 2.7 Multiprocessing Unittest workaround.
=====================================================================
Due the manner in which multiprocessing is handled on windows
and the fact that __main__.py are actually called __main__

This workaround bypasses the fact that the calling unittest
script is called __main__

http://bugs.python.org/issue10845

This should be fine for python 3.2+, however, 2.7 and before will
not likely see a fix.  This only affects the unittests called by tox.
