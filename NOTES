== mp ==

- param method tests get module + class double-prepended when loaded via
  load by name

- logging config in subprocess seems broken
- code cleanup!
- many debug prints to remove
- error handling (processes die)
- tests
- docs

- debug plugin -- what to do there? let it run in subproc ideally, can it?


== other ==

- order of events in loading from test cases prevents other plugins
  from excluding test cases from being loaded by generator
  plugin. can it work like params plugin?

- generators and params plugins should also be able to load from
  non-testcase subclasses, how is that going to work?

- unclear how to make it possible for plugins to set wasSuccessful in
  concert with each other. Need another flag probably, beside
  event.success and event.handled.
